# XXX: packagelinks problems:
#
# - We don't have information on than a package is produced by multibuild.
#   For intance, for mumps-mvapich2 package we generate spec link
#
#     https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/science/mumps-mvapich2/mumps-mvapich2.spec
#
#   but the correct url would be
#
#     https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/science/mumps/mumps.spec
#
# - There's some discrepancy with package name case 
#   We generate
#
#     https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/science/CCfits/CCfits.spec
#
#   but the correct would be
#
#     https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/science/ccfits/CCfits.spec
#
#   However we can't just fix this by lowercasing the directory, as e.g.
#
#     https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/science/Rivet/Rivet.spec
#
#   is a correct link.
